# Database-Case-Study

## Part 1
Using the Project ERD, develop create table (DDL) statements to create all the tables in the ERD. The table (DDL) statements need the following:
1.	All the tables in the ERD.
2.	All the columns or attributes in the ERD.
3.	All the Primary and Foreign Keys in the ERD.

## Part 2
Your next step in developing Bob’s Home Repair database is to add users and grant user access permissions. There are two different users of the Bob’s Home Repair database. 
1.	Bob
2.	Wendy who is the assistant that helps Bob manage his business
Add Bob as a login and user to the database and assign a secure password. (Bob’s Home Repair policy is that passwords should be at least 10 characters composed of at least one each, upper- and lower-case characters, numbers, and special characters).

Configure Bob’s database access so he can:
- View all data in all tables.
- Read/write/modify/delete any data in any table.
- No other permissions are to be available, i.e. Bob is not able to modify table structure.

Add Wendy as a login and user to the database and assign a secure password (following Bob’s Home Repair policy).
Configure Wendy’s database access so she can:
- View all data in all tables.
- Insert supplier detail information (rows) to the suppliers table.
- No other permissions are to be available.
